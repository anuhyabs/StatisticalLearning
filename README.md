# Statistical Learning

 This notebook contains my notes and solutions to exercses from [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) (second edition)
 
AIM:
- To revise ML concepts taught as part of UW Data Science Curriculum.
- For each chapter, I'll create my notes, and solve all the conceptual as well as applied exercises in R.
- Will cover chapters that were not specifically covered as a part of the curriculum as well.
- Intent to this repository is to help me prepare for data science interviews and polish my R language skills.
